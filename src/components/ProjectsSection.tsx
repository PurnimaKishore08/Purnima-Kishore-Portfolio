                    "The obesity prediction project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to classify and predict obesity levels based on individual lifestyle data. The dataset includes 17 features such as age, gender, dietary habits, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and body measurements. Data preprocessing involved label encoding, BMI calculation, and standardization. Among various models, the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 91%, effectively handling complex, non-linear relationships. In regression analysis, Random Forest again outperformed with a low RMSE of 7.18 and high R¬≤ score of 0.93. K-Means clustering revealed five distinct lifestyle patterns. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble methods in accurately estimating obesity levels from behavioral and physiological indicators, with potential applications in health risk assessment and personalized recommendations." 
                    : activeProject.title === "E-commerce Customer Segmentation" ?
                    "During my summer training at Kurious Learning Labs Pvt Ltd, I worked on this e-commerce customer segmentation project using machine learning techniques. The objective was to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and engagement patterns to support personalized marketing and customer retention strategies. I used Python and libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and implemented the KMeans clustering algorithm. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE were applied for better visualization of clusters. The project enabled actionable insights for targeted campaigns, focusing on high-value customers and improving business decision-making. This hands-on experience deepened my skills in data analysis, model building, and visualization, while reinforcing the importance of data-driven strategies in real-world applications."

                    "Fashion Sensei is an AI-powered virtual fashion mentor designed to provide personalized outfit recommendations based on individual style preferences and body measurements. Using advanced machine learning techniques, particularly K-means clustering and deep learning models like CNNs, the system analyzes user inputs‚Äîsuch as color, pattern, and clothing type preferences‚Äîto generate tailored fashion suggestions. A user-friendly interface collects these preferences and feeds them into the model, which is trained on diverse fashion datasets for both men's and women's clothing. The project achieves an accuracy of 82.5% in delivering relevant outfit suggestions, helping users confidently express their style while promoting inclusivity and sustainability in fashion. Fashion Sensei showcases the potential of combining AI with personal styling to revolutionize the online fashion experience."
                    : activeProject.title === "Jarvis Speech System" ?
                    "The Jarvis Speech Recognition System is a voice-activated personal assistant inspired by the fictional AI from Iron Woman. It is designed to interact with users through spoken commands and perform a variety of tasks such as opening applications, searching the web, answering questions, and providing real-time information like weather, time, and news updates. The system is developed using Python and integrates several key technologies including speech recognition for converting spoken words into text, natural language processing (NLP) to understand and interpret user commands, and text-to-speech (TTS) for generating vocal responses. Libraries such as SpeechRecognition, Pyttsx3, and Pyaudio are used to enable these functionalities. Additionally, APIs like OpenAI, WolframAlpha, or Wikipedia enhance the assistant's knowledge and response capabilities. The architecture involves capturing audio input, processing it to extract intent, executing the appropriate action, and delivering a voice-based output. This system finds applications in hands-free desktop operations, smart home automation, and accessibility tools, and serves as a practical introduction to AI-powered voice assistant development."
